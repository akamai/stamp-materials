= What you will find here

For each of the concepts like “hazards” or the “control model,” there is a handout that summarizes the task of filling out that part of the analysis and includes an example. These are the landscape oriented documents.

For many of those tasks, there is also a “toolkit” document – something that supports the task, e.g. a labeled control loop diagram to use while identifying the “causal scenarios.”
